# Abacus

Abacus is a C++ encryption library. Currently it only implements AES.

**Note**: Do not use Abacus in production systems that matter. It is not validated against timing attacks, or any other possible penetration methods that may be exploited by a malicious third party. At some point this may change, but if you need something now, use OpenSSL.
